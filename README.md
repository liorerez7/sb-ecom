## üìú About The Project

This project is a comprehensive e-commerce solution built from the ground up. It supports two primary user flows: a seamless shopping experience for **customers** and an intuitive management interface for **sellers**.

Authentication is handled securely using **JWT** stored in an **HttpOnly cookie**, protecting against XSS attacks. The system is designed with role-based access control (USER / SELLER / ADMIN) to ensure users can only access authorized resources.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application is deployed as a multi-container environment on a single AWS EC2 instance, orchestrated using **Docker Compose**. This setup ensures service isolation, scalability, and streamlined management.

The architecture consists of three core services working in tandem:

1.  **`web` (Nginx + React Frontend)**
    -   Serves the static, optimized React build to users on port 80.
    -   Acts as a **reverse proxy**, forwarding all API requests starting with `/api/` to the backend service, avoiding CORS issues.

2.  **`backend` (Spring Boot Application)**
    -   Exposes the RESTful API under the `/api/` path.
    -   Handles all business logic, user authentication, order processing, and server-side integration with Stripe.
    -   Serves static assets like product images from a dedicated volume.

3.  **`database` (MySQL Server)**
    -   Provides persistent storage for all application data, including users, products, and orders.
    -   Runs in its own container and communicates with the backend service over a private Docker network.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Git
-   Docker and Docker Compose

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file. This is where you'll store your secret keys and database credentials.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *Now, open the `.env` file and fill in your Stripe API keys, database password, and JWT secret.*

3.  **Build and run the application with Docker Compose:**
    This command will build the images for the frontend and backend, pull the MySQL image, and start all three containers in detached mode.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    -   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:80`.
    -   The backend API can be accessed via `http://localhost:80/api/`.
